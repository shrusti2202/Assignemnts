("TESTNAME2","LNAME%"', 6000000, "2013-02-01", "INSURANCE");


Creating Incentive Table


CREATE TABLE Incentives(
    incentive_id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, 
    employee_ref_id INT(11), FOREIGN KEY (employee_ref_id) REFERENCES employee(id),
    incentive_DATE DATETIME,
    incentive_amt INT(6) );



Inserting Data into Incentive Table


INSERT INTO incentives(employee_ref_id,incentive_DATE,incentive_amt)
VALUES
(1, '2013-02-01', 5000),
(2, '2013-02-01', 3000),
(3, '2013-02-01', 4000),
(1, '2013-01-01', 4500),
(2, '2013-01-01', 3500);



a) Get First_Name from employee table using alias name “Employee Name”. 
         SELECT first_name AS "Employee Name" FROM employee;

b) Get FIRST_NAME, Joining year, Joining Month and Joining Date from employee table.
          SELECT first_name,joining(joining_Date) AS joining_Year,
                            MONTH(joining_Date) AS joining_Month,
                            DAY(joining_Date) AS joining_Date FROM employee;

c) Get all employee details from the employee table order by First Name Ascending And Salary descending? 
  1. First Name Ascending
       SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY first_name ASC;

  2.Salary Descending
       SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY first_name DESC;

d) Get employee details from employee table whose first name contains „o‟. 
      SELECT * FROM employee WHERE first_name LIKE 'o%';

e) Get employee details from employee table whose joining month is “January”. 
      SELECT * FROM employee WHERE MONTH(joining_date) = 1;

f) Get department, total salary with respect to a department from employee table
    Order By total salary descending. 

    SELECT department, SUM(sallary) AS total_salary FROM employee GROUP BY department ORDER BY total_salary DESC;

g) Get department-wise maximum salary from employee table ordered by salary ascending

   SELECT department, MAX(sallary) AS max_salary FROM employee GROUP BY department ORDER BY max_salary ASC;

h) Select first_name, incentive amount from employee and incentives table for those employees who have incentives and incentive amount greater than 3000

    SELECT e.first_name, i.incentive_amt FROM employee e JOIN incentives i ON e.id = i.employee_ref_id WHERE i.incentive_amt > 3000;

i) Select 2nd highest salary from employee table
    SELECT MAX(sallary) AS second_highest_salary FROM employee WHERE sallary < (SELECT MAX(sallary) FROM employee);

j) Select first_name, incentive amount from employee and incentives table for all employees who got incentives using LEFT JOIN
     SELECT e.first_name, i.incentive_amt FROM employee e LEFT JOIN incentives i ON e.id =  i.employee_ref_id;

k) Create a view of Employee table which stores first name, last name, and salary only
      CREATE VIEW employeeview AS SELECT first_name, last_name, sallary FROM employee;

l) Create a procedure to find out department-wise highest salary
